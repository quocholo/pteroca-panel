# Changelog

## [0.6.0] - 2025-12-16

### Added
- Introduced a comprehensive Plugin System with full lifecycle management (scan, enable, disable, update, reset, uninstall).
- Added capability-based plugin access control for routes, entities, migrations, UI components, events, console commands, and cron tasks.
- Added plugin security validator that scans for dangerous code patterns, SQL injection risks, and path traversal vulnerabilities.
- Added plugin health check system with automated monitoring and audit logging.
- Added plugin dependency management with semantic versioning support and circular dependency detection.
- Added plugin upload functionality with ZIP archive support, security pre-scanning, and automatic installation.
- Added universal widget system supporting dashboard, admin, and navbar widgets with priority-based positioning.
- Added EasyAdmin CRUD controller support for plugins - plugins can now create CRUD interfaces for their entities that integrate seamlessly with the panel's admin interface.
- Added 40+ new event classes for event-driven architecture across multiple domains (forms, views, menus, emails, permissions, CRUD operations, widgets).
- Added 10+ new console commands for plugin management (`plugin:scan`, `plugin:enable`, `plugin:disable`, `plugin:reset`, `plugin:list`, `plugin:info`, `plugin:health`, `plugin:security-scan`, `plugin:dependencies`, `plugin:rebuild-cache`).
- Added navbar widget extension points for plugins to extend the navigation bar.
- Added comprehensive plugin development documentation including API reference, security best practices, testing guide, and troubleshooting guide.
- Added `pterodactyl_root_admin` permission to control root admin access in Pterodactyl Panel - provides flexible control independent of PteroCA admin role.
- Added granular edit permissions for Settings CRUD (`edit_settings_general`, `edit_settings_email`, `edit_settings_payment`, `edit_settings_pterodactyl`, `edit_settings_security`, `edit_settings_theme`, `edit_settings_plugin`) - separated viewing from editing permissions for better access control.
- Added plugin-specific permissions system - plugins can define custom permissions in their manifest that are automatically registered and available for role assignment.
- Added telemetry system for anonymous usage statistics and crash reporting (opt-in, fully transparent, can be disabled).
- Added Indonesian language support (thanks to the community contributors).
- Added product validation rules and improved product configuration interface.
- Added server migration command improvements with better error handling and progress reporting.
- Added support for Inter and Poppins custom fonts in the default theme.

### Changed
- Completely redesigned and refreshed the entire frontend with modern design, improved color schemes, and enhanced user experience.
- Upgraded to EasyAdminBundle v4.27.5 with full compatibility fixes for new API changes (Twig components, trans filter syntax, AdminContext methods).
- Standardized button styling system - replaced Bootstrap's verbose button classes (`btn-success`, `btn-danger`, `btn-primary`) with simplified custom classes (`success`, `danger`, `primary`, `secondary`, `warning`, `info`) for better maintainability and consistency across templates.
- Rewrote Pterodactyl API communication implementation with custom API layer for improved reliability and maintainability - completely new adapter architecture for both Application and Client APIs.
- Refactored all CLI command names to use consistent `pteroca:` namespace with hierarchical organization (e.g., `pteroca:user:*`, `pteroca:server:*`, `pteroca:plugin:*`). Old command names remain available as deprecated aliases until v1.0.0.
- Completed migration from legacy role system to new permission-based access control - replaced all hardcoded `ROLE_ADMIN` checks with granular permission checks (`access_admin_overview`, `access_servers`, `edit_server`, etc.). Updated 14 controllers, 3 services, and CLI commands to use the new `hasPermission()` method and RoleManager service.
- Removed backward compatibility layer for legacy role system - removed `UserRoleEnum` enum and legacy JSON roles fallback. All users now use the database-driven role and permission system exclusively.
- Refactored Pterodactyl admin status determination - replaced `isAdmin()` method with permission-based check using new `pterodactyl_root_admin` permission.
- Payment providers now define their own callback routes and URL building logic via interface methods - refactored payment callback system to be provider-driven instead of hard-coded. Generic callback routes `/wallet/{provider}/success` and `/wallet/{provider}/cancel` work for any payment provider.
- Plugin service loading now respects enabled/disabled state - implemented `EnabledPluginsCacheManager` to track enabled plugins in cache file. Only enabled plugins have their services registered in Symfony container during compilation, preventing disabled plugins from registering providers or services.
- Migrated event subscriber, console command, and cron task registration from compile-time to runtime for better plugin support and dynamic loading.
- Redesigned first-time configuration wizard with visual progress stepper, improved layout, and enhanced user experience.
- Improved cache:clear command performance by optimizing compiler passes.
- Enhanced form system with generic events for plugin extensibility.
- Updated email system with before/after send events for plugin hooks.
- Plugin settings now use config_schema as single source of truth - settings are defined declaratively in plugin.json and automatically created when plugin is enabled.
- Added automatic type mapping from config_schema types to UI field types - plugin config_schema types (string, integer, boolean, float, json, array) are automatically mapped to appropriate SettingTypeEnum display types.
- Improved error page templates with better styling and user-friendly messages.
- Updated flash message system to use new Twig component syntax and improved styling.
- Enhanced server management page styling and user interface.
- Updated cart configurator with improved product ordering calculator.
- Improved egg manager interface and validation.

### Fixed
- Fixed EasyAdminBundle v4.27.5 compatibility issues:
  - Fixed `Call to undefined method MenuItemDto::getAsDto()` error in DashboardController.
  - Fixed `hasContext` method not existing in AdminContext - updated to use `null != ea` check.
  - Updated flash_messages.html.twig template to use new Twig component syntax.
  - Fixed trans filter syntax from `domain =` to `domain:` throughout templates.
- Fixed disabled plugins still registering services - disabled plugins no longer have their payment providers or other services available in the container.
- Fixed button visibility issues - server control buttons (Start/Stop/Restart) and plugin action buttons now display with correct colors and styling.
- Plugin settings with 'string', 'integer' types now render correctly in UI - fixed type validation errors during plugin scanning and empty Type column display in settings UI.
- Fixed PayPal payment provider callback URL handling - each provider now defines its own callback URL format through interface methods.
- Added missing `access_server_products` permission to migration and assigned to admin role - fixes "You don't have enough permissions" error when accessing ServerProductCrudController.
- Refactored API permission checking to use granular permissions instead of deprecated `access_admin_api`.
- Fixed suspended servers listing and display issues.
- Fixed server migration command bugs and edge cases.
- Fixed product validation and configuration issues.
- Various performance optimizations and bug fixes across the system.

### Deprecated
- Routes `stripe_success` and `stripe_cancel` are deprecated and will be removed in v0.7.0. Use provider-specific callback routes (`payment_callback_success`, `payment_callback_cancel`) instead.

### Removed
- Removed `isAdmin()` method from User entity and UserInterface - use `hasPermission('pterodactyl_root_admin')` instead.
